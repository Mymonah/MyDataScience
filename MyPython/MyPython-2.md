### Hello World !

**"Hello, world!"** — I still remember this classic example, often used as the very first line of code when learning any new programming language.
Honestly, I’m not sure why this specific example is the one that's repeated across almost every language, but it has somehow become a universal tradition in programming.

I think it’s like saying: “Hi! I’m ready to code!”

```
print("Hello","World!")
```
