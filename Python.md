I started learning Python on April 11, 2025.
For anyone with a background in programming languages like C++ or Java, Python is generally easy to learn.
It is considered a high-level programming language, meaning its syntax is more similar to human language, making it more intuitive and readable.

### First we started with the environment setup:
Which refers to the platform where you can write and run your code to see results.<br/><br/>
In this case, we use **Google Colab**. As someone who enjoys learning abbreviations, I found it interesting to know that Colab stands for "Colaboratory"a blend of the words "collaboration" and "laboratory."<br/><br/>
It refers to an online environment (or virtual lab) where multiple people can collaborate in real time while experimenting, coding, and analyzing data—especially in fields like machine learning and data science.<br/><br/>
So, Google Colab (Collaboratory) is essentially a collaborative coding lab in the cloud, and is particularly well-suited for machine learning, data science, and educational purposes.<br/><br/>
It is a cloud-based, "as-a-service" version of **Jupyter Notebook** that allows you to write and execute Python code directly through your browser—no installation required.

**You can access Google Colab through Google Drive. Just follow these steps (see the image below):**

1. Open your Google Drive.
2. Right-click of My Drive.
3. Go to "More" in the menu.
4. If "Google Colaboratory" is listed, click it to create a new notebook.
5. If it’s not listed, select "Connect more apps".
6. Search for "Google Colaboratory".
7. Click "Connect" to add it to your Drive.
8. Once connected, you’ll be able to create and open Colab notebooks directly from your Google Drive.

*"You said **"Jupyter Notebook"!** what is that?"*<br/>

Jupyter Notebook is a tool you can use in your web browser to write and run code step by step.
It lets you see the results right away, which makes it perfect for learning, testing ideas, or doing data analysis.

Think of it like a digital notebook where:

- You write small pieces of code (called cells).
- You press a button to run each cell.
- The result appears just below it.
- You can also add notes and explanations between your code.
