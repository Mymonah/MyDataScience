I started learning Python on April 11, 2025.
For anyone with a background in programming languages like C++ or Java, Python is generally easy to learn.
It is considered a high-level programming language, meaning its syntax is more similar to human language, making it more intuitive and readable.


### First we started with the environment setup:
Which refers to the platform where you can write and run your code to see results.<br/><br/>
In this case, we use **Google Colab**. As someone who enjoys learning abbreviations, I found it interesting to know that Colab stands for "Colaboratory"a blend of the words "collaboration" and "laboratory."<br/><br/>
It refers to an online environment (or virtual lab) where multiple people can collaborate in real time while experimenting, coding, and analyzing data—especially in fields like machine learning and data science.<br/><br/>
So, Google Colab (Collaboratory) is essentially a collaborative coding lab in the cloud, and is particularly well-suited for machine learning, data science, and educational purposes.<br/><br/>
It is a cloud-based, "as-a-service" version of Jupyter Notebook that allows you to write and execute Python code directly through your browser—no installation required.
