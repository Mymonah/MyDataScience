The majority of people who taught PowerBI to beginners concentrated on using it as a visualization tool, but as I started learning, I found that the visualization phase comes at the end of the data reporting steps.

Yes it's an important step, because it helps you visualize your final results (which is the main goal), but it can sometimes be confusing, especially if you haven't previously built a solid foundation in data basics.

## The main typical steps in PowerBI Data reporting:


### Thinking and problem-solving:
  
The most important step in creating any Power BI reportâ€”or doing any kind of data analysis â€” is understanding the actual problem. Before jumping into charts or dashboards, you need to take a step back and really think about what you're trying to solve.

In any business, when something goes wrong or needs improvement, the first thing people want to know is *why*. Thatâ€™s where you come in. Your job isnâ€™t just to make a nice-looking reportâ€”itâ€™s to dig into the data and help figure out whatâ€™s going on.

Stakeholders not only want you to create a colorful visual attractive report. They want answers. They want insights that can help them make smart decisions and get to the root of the issue. Thatâ€™s why the thinking and problem-solving part is so importantâ€”itâ€™s what gives your report real purpose.
