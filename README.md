Hello again,<br/>
Please consider these words to be personal thoughts rather than professional advice.<br/>
Here, I outline my entire journey toward the buzzword of the dayâ€” **Data Science**.<br/>

## PowerBI
The journey started with powerBI, it's also so trendy, you hear this word almost all the time, and occasionally you could ask yourself:<br/>
"What's going on?!"<br/> 
"Where am I from all these stuff??"

Initially, when I searched for PowerBI for beginners on Google, I found this helpful YouTube channel:<br/> **Pragmatic works** | 
[ULTIMATE Power BI Tutorial ðŸ“Š Beginner to Pro Course (2024)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk25lwdTKow)

The majority of people who taught PowerBI to beginners concentrated on using it as a visualization tool, but as I started learning, I found that the visualization phase comes at the end of the data processing steps.

Yes it's an important step, because it helps you visualize your final results (which is the main goal), but it can sometimes be confusing, especially if you haven't previously built a solid foundation in data basics.
